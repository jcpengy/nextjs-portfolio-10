                At the University of Pennsylvania, I majored in <u><a href="http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/dmd.html">Digital
                Media Design</a></u> and minored in Fine Arts with a
                focus in 3D modeling. I also interned at the
                New York Times where I researched VR/AR technology on the Immersive Storytelling Team.<br/><br/>

                As both a designer and developer at Adobe (and previously a consultant), I've gained experience in all
                areas of the product lifecycle and currently strive to build internal web tools that are simple,
                intuitive, and accessible. Although I enjoy seeing
                my ideas come to life through development, I'm excited to focus on and grow my design skills on upcoming
                projects.<br/><br/>
