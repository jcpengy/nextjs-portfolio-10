        I'm an SF-based <b>Front-End Engineer at Adobe</b>. I build internal tools
        on the Digital Experience Customer Engineering team.

          I love creative challenges and learning new things. From
          doodling cartoons and dream houses as a toddler to building hamster cages as a middle schooler,
          I developed an interest in art and engineering that continued throughout my college and professional experiences.<br/><br/>

          At the University of Pennsylvania, I majored in <u><a href="https://www.instagram.com/officialceojess/">Digital
          Media Design</a></u> and minored in Fine Arts with a
          focus in 3D modeling. I also interned at the
          New York Times where I researched VR technology and contributed graphics on the Immersive Storytelling Team.<br/><br/>

          3D model I created of my college apartment<br/><br/>
          At Adobe, I've been able to apply and learn creative problem solving skills through a variety of projects.
          As a Front-End Developer, I assume the role of both designer and developer to create internal web
          applications that simplify customer data processes in Adobe Experience Platform. I love seeing my ideas come to
          life through development, but I'm excited to focus on and grow my design skills on upcoming projects.<br/><br/>
