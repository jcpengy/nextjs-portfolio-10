          I love creative challenges and learning new things. From
          doodling cartoons and dream houses as a toddler to building hamster cages as a middle schooler,
          I developed an interest in art and engineering that continued throughout my college and professional experiences.<br/><br/>

          At the University of Pennsylvania, I majored in <u><a href="http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/dmd.html">Digital
          Media Design</a></u> and minored in Fine Arts with a
          focus in 3D modeling. I also interned at the
          New York Times where I researched VR/AR technology on the Immersive Storytelling Team.<br/><br/>

          As both a designer and developer at Adobe (and previously a consultant), I've gained experience in all areas
           of the product lifecycle and currently strive to build internal web tools that are simple,
          intuitive, and accessible. Although I enjoy seeing
          my ideas come to life through development, I'm excited to focus on and grow my design skills on upcoming projects.<br/><br/>
