      <p className="my-5">
        I'm an SF-based <b>Front-End Engineer at Adobe</b>. I build internal tools
        on the Digital Experience Customer Engineering team.

        <hr/><br/>

          I'm a visual thinker who likes creative challenges and learning new things. From
          doodling cartoons and dream houses as a toddler to building hamster cages as a middle schooler,
          I developed an interest in art and engineering that flourished in my educational and professional experiences.
          At the University of Pennsylvania, I majored in an interdisciplinary program called <u><a href="https://www.instagram.com/officialceojess/">Digital Media Design</a></u> and minored in Fine Arts with a
          focus in 3D modeling. During that time, I also interned at the
          New York Times where I researched VR technology and contributed graphics on the Immersive Storytelling Team. I
          also had the unique opportunity to compete in the <u><a href="https://www.instagram.com/officialceojess/">Walt Disney Imaginations Design Competition</a></u> in 2018,
          where my team presented a theme park idea for an abandoned space to company executives.<br/><br/>
          At Adobe, I've continued to apply and learn creative problem solving skills through a variety of projects.
          As a Technical Consultant, I designed and developed a web application that streamlines documentation of large customer workflows in
          Adobe Campaign Standard. As a Front-End Developer, I've created mock ups and
          developed internal web applications that simplify complex customer data processes
          in Adobe Experience Platform. I love developing simple, intuitive experiences that bring everyday value to
          customers and am excited to continue my design journey on upcoming projects.<br/><br/>
