        I'm an SF-based <b>Front-End Engineer at Adobe</b>. I build internal tools
        on the Digital Experience Customer Engineering team.

          I'm a visual thinker who likes creative challenges and learning new things. From
          doodling cartoons and dream houses as a toddler to building hamster cages as a middle schooler,
          I developed an interest in art and engineering that continued into my college and professional experiences.
          At the University of Pennsylvania, I majored in <u><a href="https://www.instagram.com/officialceojess/">Digital
          Media Design</a></u> and minored in Fine Arts with a
          focus in 3D modeling. I also interned at the
          New York Times where I researched VR technology and contributed graphics on the Immersive Storytelling Team.<br/><br/>
          At Adobe, I've been able to apply and learn creative problem solving skills through a variety of projects.
          As a Technical Consultant, I designed and developed a web application that streamlines documentation of large customer workflows in
          Adobe Campaign Standard. As a Front-End Developer, I've created mock ups and
          developed internal web applications that simplify complex customer data processes
          in Adobe Experience Platform. I love developing simple, intuitive experiences that bring everyday value to
          customers and am excited to continue my design journey on upcoming projects.<br/><br/>
